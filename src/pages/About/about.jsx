              HelloðŸ‘‹ there, folks my name is <span>Arit Srivastava</span> and
              I&apos;m a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in
              learning new technologies. I am a budding developer who is pro at
              Google-fu and Stack Overflow-ing. As a web developer, I am
              constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills and explore
              new technologies. This project has been an exciting jouney for me,
              allowing me to dive deep into the world of data visualization on
              the web and gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tool like
              Chart.js.
            </p>
            <p className="intro">
              Throughout the development of this website, I&apos;ve had the
              opportunity to learn and experiment with Chart.js, a powerful
              JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive charts.
              From understanding its core concepts to implementing advanced
              features, Chart.js has opened up a whole new realm of
              possibilities for visualizing data on the web and I am excited to
              share this project with you
